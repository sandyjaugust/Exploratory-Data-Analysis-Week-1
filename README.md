# Data
The data for this project contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The data set can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php. A copy of the data is included in this repo as well.
